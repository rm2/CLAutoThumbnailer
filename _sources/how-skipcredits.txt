 Skip the video credits
========================

By default |CLATN| will skip the first and last 5 seconds of a
video. Opening and closing credits usually last longer than this
however. We really don't want to see the credits in the Overview
thumbnail page so let's get rid of them. By looking at "His Girl
Friday"s Detail thumbnail pages generated in the :doc:`quickstart` and
using |BSP|_â€™s :guilabel:`Jump to time` dialog box, we can determine
that we want to start thumbnailing at :mono:`0:0:59` and stop at
:mono:`1:31:07`.

So the credits can be skipped by running the following command::

   clatn -i 0 -s 0:0:59 -e 1:31:07 "his_girl_friday_512kb.mp4"

where the :option:`-s` option is used to specify the starting time and
the :option:`-e` option the ending time. We also specify ``-i 0`` to
avoid regenerating the 35 multi-page thumbnail pages (see :option:`-i`
for more details). The command prints the following output to the
Command Prompt window::

and generates the following thumbnail page:

   :scale: 50%
   :align: center

   :target: _images/his_girl_friday_512kb_nocredits_overview.jpg

   "No Credits" Overview Thumbnail Page for "His Girl Friday"

To skip the credits in "McLintock!", run the following command::

   clatn -i 0 -s 0:1:59 -e 2:06:39 McLintock_512kb.mp4

to see::

   Processing C:\McLintock (1963)\mp4 512kb\McLintock_512kb.mp4 ...
   0:00:10 Total time to create AVFileSet.
   Thumbnails Range   0:01:59.000 -> 2:06:39.000
