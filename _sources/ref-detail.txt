 Detail Thumbnail Pages
========================

Thumbnail pages that contain thumbnails that are generated a fixed
amount of time from each other (like every minute). Detail pages will be
made as needed until the entire video has been thumbnailed. Typically
with a smaller number of rows and columns (in the range of 3-6) than a
:doc:`ref-overview`. Detail page generation can be turned off by using
the :option:`-i` option.
